# SG4SVI

This python code implements smoothed gradient (SG) for stochastic variational inference (SVI)
in latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model presented in the paper
 "Smoothed Gradients for Stochastic Variational Inference", Mandt S. and Blei D, NIPS 2014.

This code is based on the project of blei-lab/onlineldavb (https://github.com/blei-lab/onlineldavb)
